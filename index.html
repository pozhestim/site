                    This is the release that literally all drone owners and fans of bird's-eye shooting have been waiting for.
                    Finally, the moment has arrived, the company, a leading manufacturer of drones, introduces the new quadcopter DJI Mavic 3.
                    How it is presented, we will consider in the review. The new DJI Mavic 3 is the logical continuation of the Mavic 2 drone series.
                    And yet it should be classified as potentially new, different from the previous ones. 
                    First of all, it is worth saying that the novelty is presented in three modifications: in addition to the basic DJI Mavic 3, there 
                    is also Fly More Combo and Cine Premium Combo. 
                    The third Mavic has received two camera sensors at once and has now essentially combined the capabilities of its two predecessors. 
                    The wide-angle sensor has been given a 20 MP resolution with a focal length of 24 mm and an aperture of f/2.8. 
                    The second sensor is a telephoto 12 MP lens with a focal length of 160 mm. The flight time has increased significantly and is now 
                    46 minutes with a modest size and weight of just 920 grams. 
                    Also, incredibly, the new drone can be charged directly through a USB-C cable without removing the battery. Read on to find out more 
                    about it.

                    The design of the first Mavic Pro proved to be a revolutionary innovation back when the Phantom line was in demand and praise.
                     For the first time, a model of a folding drone was presented, which made it an engineering masterpiece.
                     But not only folding forms won the hearts of millions of fans, but also the possibility of shooting in 4K, and most importantly, the ratio
                     portability and rich functionality, including longer flight time, high-quality shooting, and the first intelligent modes.
                    
                     The success of Mavic grew rapidly and later split into two lines: amateur and professional. The leaders of the first were
                     quadcopter Mavic Mini and Air, later more advanced, updated models DJI Mini 2 and DJI Air 2S. The professional line included
                     the legendary Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom. Both of them were introduced in 2018 and to this day are leaders in demand.
                     As many have noticed, the appearance of quadcopters has been upgraded with each new model introduced. It's not colossal
                     changes, but obvious in the ratio of sizes and functional set. For example, the latest DJI Air 2S began to have smoother streamlined shapes,
                     different colors and noticeable bright orange stripes on the blades. In general, this feature arose in all recent models.

                     What is Mavic 3? The drone has a user-familiar appearance, and is a cross between the previous one.
                     generation and Air 2S. What catches the eye, the new drone is equipped with additional air intakes in the upper, middle
                     and lower parts of the case, which provides less heating of the battery and versatile additional cooling.
                     Speaking of the battery, the manufacturer did not place it in the usual place at the top, but in a separate compartment on the back in the Phantom style with
                     locking mechanism at the back.
                     Most likely, it was this removal of the battery from the Mavic 3 that allowed the maximum flight time to be shifted to 46 minutes.
